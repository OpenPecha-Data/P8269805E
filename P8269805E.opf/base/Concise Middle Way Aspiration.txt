Concise Middle Way Aspiration
by Khenpo Shenpen Nangwa

namshyik pal gyi ri la ludrub jé
When Lord Nāgārjuna teaches the excellent path
kalden düpé tsok kyi yong kor né
Of the Middle Way beyond extremes upon Śrī Parvata
tadral umé lamzang chepa na
Surrounded by an assembly of the fortunate
dak kyang khor gyi tokmar kyewar shok
May I be born as the very first among his retinue.

detsé shejé chönyi namkhé ta
At that time, with unrivalled discernment that gauges
shyalwar namchö tsungpar mepa yi
The limits of the space-like reality of knowable things,
chö tar chöpa tamché sün chung né
May I refute all false imitations of Dharma,
pakpé gongpa trulmé tönpar shok
And reveal without error the Ārya’s true intent.
