Declaration of the Power of Truth
A Prayer to Overcome Invading Forces
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

könchok tsa sum gyatsö den tob dang
Through the power of the truth of the Three Jewels and the oceanic Three Roots,
khyepar rigdzin dorjé drakstal gyi
Especially the vidyādhara Dorje Drakpo Tsal,
tutob nüpa kalpé mé shyin bor
May all their power, force and strength blaze forth like apocalyptic flames
tamak marpö pungtsok lhakmé sek
To burn away the invading forces of the Red Army until none remains.
lalö dün drö jema chu luk shyin
May the machinations of these barbarians dissipate like sand in water,
nümé rang shyi gyur né gyalwé ten
And may they be naturally subdued, rendered powerless, so that the teachings of the victorious
Buddha,
dé dzin dé dang chepa nö tsedral
Together with all the ranks of those who uphold them, remain intact and unscathed.
samdön yishyin drubpar jingyi lob
Grant your blessings so that this aspiration may be fulfilled according to our wishes.

Composed on the fist day of the Month of Miracles, Water Dragon year. May virtue abound.
