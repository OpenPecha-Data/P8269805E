by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

om ah hung benza guru pema siddhi hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
chok chu dü sum gyalwa sé ché dang
All the victors and their heirs throughout the ten directions and three times,
khyepar tönpa nyammé shakyé gyal
But especially the peerless teacher, king of the Śākyas,
nyesé gyé dang té rab neten dang
The eight close sons, sthavira hierarchs,
dzamling gyen druk mejung lobpön ché
Six ornaments of this world and two marvellous ācāryas,
rigdzin nam gyé drubchen gyechu dang
Eight vidyādharas, eighty-four mahāsiddhas,
kündü rigdzin pema sambhawa
And the vidyādhara Padmasambhava who embodies them all,
tsen chok gyé dang trul tsen shyibchu dang
His eight supreme manifestations and forty secondary emanations,
daki nam nyi jebang nyishu nga
As well as the two ḍākinīs, twenty-five disciples,
tubwang nyipa shyitso ati sha
Śāntarakṣita, the second lord of sages, Atiśa,
sar nying khedrub rigpa dzin nam dang
And all the learned and accomplished vidyādharas of the New and Ancient traditions,
trulpé tertön gya tsa lasokpa
The hundred emanated treasure-revealers,
rigdzin lama jewa saya dang
And all the many millions of vidyādhara gurus,
gyüdé shyi dang khyepar drubdé gyé
As well as the inconceivable maṇḍalas of peaceful and wrathful deities
palchen kadü lama gongpa dü
Of the four classes of tantra, especially the eight sādhana classes,
do dang gyutrul dü kyi khorlo sok
The glorious Assembled Word, Embodiment of the Guru’s Intention,
shyi dang trowö kyilkhor samyé dang
Sūtra Combining All Intentions, Illusory Net, Wheel of Time and so on,
jetsün drolma nyurma pamö shyab
Noble Tārā, who is swift and valiant,
pakmo seng dong né sum pawo dang
Vajravārāhī, Siṃhamukhā, vīras of the three domains,
naljorma pal jewa bumtrak tsok
And all the thousands and millions of glorious yoginīs,
gön chen dé nga maning shying kyong dang
As well as the five classes of Gönpo and Maning and Shingkyong,
ngaksung khyabjuk damchen dorjé lek
The Mantra Protectress, Rāhula, Damchen Dorje Lekpa,
drekpé depön sumchu lasokpa
The thirty commanders of the haughty spirits, and so on,
gyü sum damchen drek tsok khor ché dang
All the oath-bound ones of the three tantra classes, together with their retinues, the hosts
of arrogant spirits,
tsangri gönpo dünchu tsa nga ché
And the seventy-five lords of pure lineage,
namsé dzam lha norlha gyamtso dang
Together with Vaiśravaṇa, Jambhala, and an ocean of wealth deities,
tsering ché nga tenma gul lha sok
As well as the Five Sisters of Long Life, Tenma goddesses, deities of the upper slopes,
ten la gawé karchok kyong nam dang
And all those guardians of virtue who delight in the teachings,
né dang ter gyi dakpo ché nam sok
Together with local protectors and the great keepers of treasures, and the rest—
dorna tsa sum rabjam tukjé dang
In short, we invoke the compassion of the infinite deities of the Three Roots,
jinlab tutob denpé tsal truk té
As well as their blessings, power and strength and the force of truth.

dani tukjé pa tsön rab kyé dé
Now that we have reached the end of this period of fivefold degeneration,
nyikma nga dö ta la tukpa yi
The sun of happiness is setting upon the teachings and beings;
ten dang drowé dekyi nyi nyur tsam
Holders of the teachings and benefactors have been reduced
tendzin kyé dang tenpé jindak nam
To the ranks of common folk and lost their authority and influence;
mang su beb shing ngatang trokpa dang
And the curative Wheel of Dharma is on the verge of destruction.
chökhor nyenpo jik la nyewé na
Have all of you lost the power of your noble aspirations?
khyé nam tukkyé nüpa zé dam chi
Can you not hear our fervent prayers of devotion,
dakchak nyintsen dungshuk drakpo yi
With which you we call out to you, day and night?

dé mö soldeb nyen gyi ma sen nam
Now, let us summon the valorous forces of compassion
nakchok dukpé chompar magyur gang
To protect what has not been destroyed by the forces of evil,
kyobpa dzö chik chom zin chishyik jé
For what would be the point of acting only when it’s all no more?

dena sang sum trinlé tsalshuk kyi
Thus, let the might of your activity of the three secrets
nütu kalpé mé shyin bar du sol
Blaze forth just like the infernos at the end of time, we pray!

khyepar guru pema drakpo yi
And since the forceful Guru Padma, in particular,
bé né gang drakri ling lasokpé
Vowed to afford protection from the terrors of invasion
du ru kha yi jik lé kyobwo shyé
In hidden lands, snowy peaks and mountain sanctuaries,
shyalshyé damcha dzün du zé dam chi
Let us see if this commitment was more than mere falsehood.

ngön mön denpé kyebu lama dang
According to the aspirations made in the past
daki lungten trulmé tebpa yi
And the infallible prophecies of gurus and ḍākinīs,
dani nyurdu neyul bepa nam
Reveal for us now, swiftly and without hindrance,
kawa mepar jé né tendzin dang
The hidden lands wherein holders of the teachings
deden kyewo pomö ukyung dzö
And faithful men and women may find relief!

dé lé galkyen nyertsé rik tadak
Let Dorje Drolö, king of the wrathful conquerors of Māra,
dü lé gyalwé trogyal drowolö
Who blazes like a fire of red-hot iron,
drenpé mö lé chak sek mé shyindu
Naturally pacify all forms of harm and adversity and fulfil our every wish,
ngang gi shyi né sampé dön kün drub
At the very moment that we bring him to mind.

guru pejung khyé kyi lam na drong
Let Guru Padmākara lead the way,
chökyong sungma nam kyi gyab né kyob
The dharma protectors and guardians defend us from behind,
karchok kyongwa nam kyi drok dzö chik
And all the forces of virtue offer their assistance!

dü lé nampar gyalwé pal tob ching
May we gain the splendour of victory over Māra,
tsesö dögü jorpa gyepa dang
May our lifespan, merit and resources all increase,
lung dang ngönpar tokpé yönten nam
And may our qualities of scriptural learning and realization
karpö chok shyin gong né gongpel shok
Develop further and further, just like the waxing moon!

nöchü tendrel nyepé tsok kün shyi
May all harmful circumstances in the outer and inner world be pacified,
chi nang sangwé tendrel shuk jung drub
May outer, inner and secret positivity be spontaneously accomplished,
nyé tsok tarnang gé shying shipar gyur
May all that seems harmful be transformed into virtue and auspiciousness,
tendrel pünsum tsokpé tashi shok
And may all be auspicious so that fortune prevails in perfect abundance!

jitar mönpa di shyin drubpa la
May the Three Jewels and oceanic Three Roots grant their blessings,
könchok tsa sum gyatsö jingyi lob
So that this aspiration may be fulfilled just as we wish.

chönyi rangshyin nampar dakpa dang
By the utterly pure nature of dharmatā—reality-as-such,
chöchen gyundré tendrel lumé kyi
And the unfailing interdependence of conditioned things,
denpé tob kyi wang du jorpa dang
May all be brought within our power through the force of truth,
künkhyen gyalwé tenpa dargyé shok
And the teachings of the omniscient Victorious One spread far and wide!

Thus, on the fifteenth day of the fifth month of the Wood Sheep year Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö composed
this at the Dharma centre of Dzongsar Tashi Lhatsé. Sarva maṅgalam.
