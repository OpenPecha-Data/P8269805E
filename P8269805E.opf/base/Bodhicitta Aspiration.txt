Bodhicitta Aspiration

by Nyoshul Lungtok Tenpé Nyima

Namo!Foremost, sublime, and most venerable root and lineage masters, pray inspire me to become
just like you!

Oceanic hosts of the three jewels, three roots, buddhas, and bodhisattvas, inspire me to become
just like you!

The profound meaning of the definitive sūtras, tantras and pith instructions, the subject at
hand, is precious bodhicitta, relative and ultimate. In their common aspect the two bodhicittas
are the six perfect actions; in the uncommon the extraordinary method and wisdom of
the outer and inner tantras. In particular, they are the supreme vehicle of the highest and
most secret Great Perfection, a unity of primordial purity and spontaneous presence, the
precious and most blissful mind of enlightenment – the wisdom of compassionate awareness.


This Great Perfection is the naturally uncontrived; the singular, most sublime, and ultimate
path traversed by the vidyādharas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas of the three times. Pray bless
both myself and all beings, my very own parents, that it might arise perfectly within us.


Bless us such that when rich and in good circumstance, or down and out; when strong or weak,
happy or sad, sick, dying or taking birth, in fact, at all times and in all circumstances,
we may recall and actualize two-fold bodhicitta.

Whatever difficult circumstances befall us and cause us obstacles, be they arising from inside,
outside, or in some secret way, may this profound dharma be our friend and help us on
our way; may all negative conditions be taken as the practice and, more to the point, pray
bless us that when we come into contact with them they may prove to be the catalyst for a
deep and meaningful enhancement of our practice and path toward awakening.

This is the fine supplication of the old monk, Lungtok. May it prove to be auspicious!
