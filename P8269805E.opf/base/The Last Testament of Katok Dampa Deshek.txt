May the teachings of the Buddha remain for long,
tekpé gyalpo shintu dar gyur chik
May the king of all vehicles flourish and spread,
tenpa dzin nam shyabpé ten gyur chik
May the lives of the holders of the teachings be secure,
ten la nö nam ming tsam tong gyur chik
May all obstructions to the teachings be eradicated entirely,
dro kün sangye tobpé gyur gyur chik
And may this aspiration be a cause for all beings attaining enlightenment.

This was spoken as the last testament of Dampa Deshek of Kathok (1122–1192) at the moment of
his death, on the eighteenth day of the month of Saga Dawa.
